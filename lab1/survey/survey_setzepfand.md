# Students survey

> This survey is designed to provide some information about your background and expectations about the course, such that I could adjust the course content, speed of delivery, assessment, and other parameters to better suit your needs.

> The data collected with this survey will be kept confidential and has no influence on your grade.

## 1. What is your name and preferred name if any?

Paul Setzepfand

## 2. What is your current title and affiliation/position? What year of the program are you in? Also add a link to your webpage if you have one.

first-year PhD candidate at UiO; my department profile can be found here: https://www.sv.uio.no/econ/english/people/aca/paulsetz/index.html

## 3. What is your primary field of research interests?

labor economics (subject to change, given I'm first-year); applied micro more broadly

## 4. What interests you in structural estimation?

"active" goal --> building a more diverse methodological skill set, with intentions to incorporate it into my own research (structural labor/education, etc.)

"passive" goal --> help me better understand structural papers in my fields of interest

## 5. What is your previous econometrics training? Briefly list the models and methods you have studied, ideally indicating which ones you have had practical experience with, and using which software packages.

coursework:

Advanced Econometrics (MA) at U of Mannheim; pure theory
Advanced Microeconometrics (MA) at U of Mannheim; pure theory
Advanced Applied Econometrics (PhD) at U of Oslo; pure theory

plus a bunch of field courses with applied focus (applied IO, applied labor, applied public, ...)

methods:

linear and non-linear regression (w/ extension to panel data)
MLE and moments-based estimators
semi- and non-parametric econometrics
applied methods for causal inference (IV, RDD, ...)
some structural econometrics from applied IO course

## 6. What is your coding experience? List the programming languages that you have used in the past.

Stata (preferred): using it in basically all my work, so all around fairly proficient in it
R: some basic knowledge, only using it if needed (e.g., when there is a strong preference for it on the part of my collaborators)
Python: somewhat frequently used for stuff that I cannot code in Stata, e.g., webscraping or machine learning
MATLAB: used once in aforementioned applied IO course, never opened again
Julia: used for some basic dynamic programming some years ago (Advanced Macroeconomics at U of Mannheim)

## 7. What are your expectations of this course?

(i) provide overview over key concepts and methods in structural econometrics
(ii) identify how these methods fit into my own research agenda
(iii) strengthen my coding and coding practices (Git, etc.)
(iv) potentially use course project as basis for a research project

## 8. Will you be taking exam to receive credit for this course?

yes!
